Assignment 2 Group A SQL Queries:
a. Design and Develop SQL DDL statements which demonstrate the use of SQL objects such as Table, View, Index, Sequence, Synonym, different constraints etc.
b. Write at least 10 SQL queries on the suitable database application using SQL DML statements.
Note: Instructor will design the queries which demonstrate the use of concepts like Insert, Select, Update, Delete with operators, functions, and set operator etc.

/* 1. Create a base table */

/* 5. Create a VIEW to see only high scoring students */
CREATE VIEW High_Scorers AS

/* 6. Create a SEQUENCE for auto-generating student IDs */

   PART B: DML QUERIES
   ========== */

/* 1. Insert sample records */
